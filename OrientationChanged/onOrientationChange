on Orientation changed, your activity by default will restart.

That means that onDestroy() and onCreate() will be called again, and you may lose some information.

If you don't want to restart your activity, or would like to handle any changes yourself, do the following:

[1] declare in AndroidManifest.xml you can handle it yourself:
       <activity
            android:name=".WiFiDirectActivity"
            android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize" ...
       />

[2] Override
    @Override
    public void onConfigurationChanged(Configuration configuration){
        super.onConfigurationChanged(configuration);
	//do optional stuff
	if (configuration.orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_LANSCAPE){

	} ...
    }


Your app will still be allowed to flip around. You just won't lose your data.
