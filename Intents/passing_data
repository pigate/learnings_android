To pass data between one activity to another, esp. when one activity is started from within another activity, and when finish second activity, come back to first activity...

- Use Intent with startActivityForResult/onActivityResult() to map connection between the activities to ensure it will return to caller when done

- Use Bundle to package up lots of data
	Or put stuff into Intent if only few data fields to pass


Can use codes between the activity to signal how Activity 2 will act:

Activity1 passes 3 fields to Activity 2: rowId, title, body
2 activity codes: ACTIVITY_CREATE, ACTIVITY_EDIT

Activity1 -> Activity2 -+

//Activity1
@Override
protected void editNote(long id, String title, String body){
  //...
  Intent i = new Intent(this, Activity2.class);
  i.putExtra("ROW_ID", id);
  i.putExtra("TITLE", title);
  i.putExtra("BODY", body);
  startActivityForResult(i, ACTIVITY_EDIT);
}

private void createNote(){
  Intent i = new Intent(this, Activity2.class);
  startActivityForResult(i, ACTIVITY_CREATE);
}

@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultcode, Intent intent){
  super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, intent);
  Bundle extras = intent.getExtras();
  switch(requestCode){
    case ACTIVITY_CREATE:
       
    case ACTIVITY_EDIT:
  }
}
